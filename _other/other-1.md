> Our 2024 McCarthy Award for Public Service celebration honoring Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi in November was an evening filled with the centerâ€™s friends, donors, stakeholders, and students!  Fifteen McCarthy Center students who served as ambassadors, helped our guests to see the success that they support. Hear from some of our students as they reflect on their take-aways from that night.
