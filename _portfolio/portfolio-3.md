## Abstract
> Can individuals successfully keep a thought out of mind? Wegner et al. (1987) showed that attempting to suppress a thought paradoxically can cause a rebound effect - an increase in the accessibility of the given thought after suppression. These findings suggest that thought suppression is challenging and that attempts to control thought in this way can inadvertently make things worse. In these studies, though, participants were not given any practice with thought suppression and were given no guidance about how to approach the task. Perhaps participants struggled because they were not able to come up with strategies for engaging in thought suppression.<br><br>In our current study, we had participants (n=223) perform a task similar to Wegner et al. (1987), but we included a between-subjects manipulation of the instructions that participants were given. One group was given no special instructions - like the participants in the original study - whereas two other groups were instructed to suppress the thought by substituting an alternative thought or by keeping their mind blank and avoiding thinking of anything. In our procedure, participants had a one minute practice trial where they practiced stream of consciousness verbalization. Then the experimental group was instructed to not think of a white bear (initial suppression), while controls were asked to think of a white bear (initial expression) for five minutes. In the second trial, participants in the experimental group were asked to think of a white bear, and controls were asked not to think of a white bear while continuing to verbalize their thoughts. Collapsing across the different instruction conditions, we replicated the rebound effect with more target thought occurrences in the expression phase for the experimental group (M = 29.7) than for the control group  (M = 23.2), F(1, 222) = 6.61, p < 0.05. Contrary to our expectations, however, the instruction manipulation did not influence the size of the rebound effect, F(2, 222) = 1.574, p = 0.20. This suggests that providing a strategy to participants does not increase success of thought suppression.
