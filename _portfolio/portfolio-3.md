## Abstract
> Mental health is a significant factor in overall health as it affects the risk for many conditions. One possible contributor is birth order; some research suggests that later-borns experience higher mental well-being than first-borns. According to intersectionality theories and the multiple jeopardy hypothesis, being a member of multiple marginalized groups can also result in interactive detrimental effects. Additional research suggests that people with various mental health conditions experience different effects on their mental health, which influences intervention design. This correlational study conducted on university students (n = 115) aimed to replicate the effects of birth order on mental well-being and explore which particular aspects of mental well-being may be affected by birth order. The study filled a gap by recruiting a sample with more women and people of immigrant backgrounds. Per the intersectionality theory, it also aimed to determine whether there is an interaction effect between being a first-born, coming from an immigration background, and identifying as a woman on mental well-being. Neither a replication of the birth order effect nor an interaction effect between birth order, gender, and immigration background were found. Exploratory analyses suggest that only children experience more Positive Relations With Others than later-borns. This protective effect seems to only apply to non-immigrants as they exhibit higher Self-Acceptance than people of immigrant backgrounds. Future studies may dissect this potential interaction between birth order and immigrant background.
